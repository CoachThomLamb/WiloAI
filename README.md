# Welcome to Wilo the Habit Hound  ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).
The example app has been replace by the workout tracking app. 
This is very early stages. 
I'm Thom Lamb and I built this app to learn Expo and because I love working out. I'm hoping to eventually use it to train other people but we will see. 
For now it's just a place for me to work on dev skills and connect with other people who love to build stuff and maybe like to work out as well. 
Thanks for stopping by. 


## Get started

For now I'm just posting this repo to share the code with other developers. If anyone wants detailed instructions on how to run it and can't figure it out from looking at the Expo docs I will put it here. 
In order to that I'd just clone the repo myself and do a fresh build. This is mostly a note to myself. 
Also heads up I'm using Zustand and Pocketbase. Not sure I will keep using either. They are both nice but who knows?
